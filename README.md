# **Starfish Wipeout**

## **Project Description**
This project is a reskin of the classic arcade game *Asteroids*. Instead of outer space, the action takes place underwater. Players control a submarine navigating through an ocean filled with starfish invaders. The goal is to avoid or destroy the starfish while surviving as long as possible.

## **Usage Instructions**
