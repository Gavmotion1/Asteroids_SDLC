# Project Proposal

## **User Story 1: Player Reaches End of Game**
As a player,  
I want to see a game over screen when I lose all my lives,  
So that I understand that the game has ended and can decide if I want to try again.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- When the player loses all lives, the game should display a “Game Over” screen.  
- The “Game Over” screen should include an option to return to the main menu or start a new game.

## **User Story 2: Player Avoids Collisions with Starfish**
As a player,  
I want to know when I collide with objects,  
So that I can track my lives while playing.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- The player should lose one life each time they collide with a starfish or other obstacles.  
- The player’s remaining lives should be clearly displayed on the screen, updating after each collision.

## **User Story 3: Player Achieves High Score**
As a player,  
I want to keep track of my high score,  
So that I can try to beat my best score and compete with others.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- The game should display the player’s current score during gameplay.  
- At the end of each game, a screen should show the highest scores achieved by the player or across all players next to the game score that was just played.

## **User Story 4: Player Shoots Starfish to Clear the Screen**
As a player,  
I want to shoot projectiles to destroy large starfish and any other threats,  
So that I can prevent them from colliding with me.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- The player should be able to shoot projectiles from their ship to destroy starfish.  
- When a large starfish is hit, it should split into smaller, faster-moving fragments that continue floating on the screen.

## **User Story 5: Player Controls Ship with Inertia**
As a player,  
I want to control my ship with inertia and adjust my direction using thrust,  
So that I can navigate the underwater field effectively.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- The player’s ship should continue drifting after movement until the player actively changes direction or uses thrust.  
- The ship’s controls should allow the player to rotate and move in any direction, making navigation smoother and more realistic.
